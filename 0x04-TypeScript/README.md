To test your TypeScript project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have all the dependencies installed by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**: To start the development server, which will compile your TypeScript code and serve it on a local server, run:
   ```
   npm run start-dev
   ```

3. **Build**: If you want to build your project for production, you can run:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This command will compile your TypeScript code and bundle it into a single JavaScript file ready for deployment.

4. **Run Tests**: To run tests using Jest, execute:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
   This command will run all the tests defined in your project using Jest.

After running these commands, you should be able to access your TypeScript application in your web browser and verify that it's working as expected.

Additionally, any test cases you've defined should be executed, and you'll see the results in your terminal.
